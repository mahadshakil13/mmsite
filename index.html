<h3 class = "awards"> 1st Place - Andrew Garfeild in "The Social Network" </h3>

<p class = "awards">Andrew has always been a phenomonal actor, racking up 13 awards in his time, winning the Golden Globe for his performance in Tick, Tick Boom just recentely in 2022.
He has also appeared as the infamous Spider-Man in what should have been the best trilogy, but was cut short due to health issues. In my opinion, his best work
was done playing Eduardo in the Social Network, and the particular scene is when he confronts Matt, played by Jesse Eisenberg, for robbing him from his portion
of the company. </p>

<h3 class = "awards"> 2nd Place - Steve Carell in "The Office"</h3>

<p class = "awards">The office has been and always will be one of the best and respected television shows of all time. That high praise is due tue its perfect 
casting, good directing, and phenomenal chemistry between the actors on set. However, with so many choices to choose from, picking one was not that difficult,
and in the end, I went with Michael Scotts actor Steve Carrel. He played the role perfectly, and as a fan felt nothing but love for him as a character. And when he returned for the
final episode of the show, fans felt nothing but happiness to see him again.</p>

<h3 class = "awards"> 3rd Place - Robert Downey Jr. in the "Iron Man" trilogy </h3>

<p class = "awards">Robert was a somewhat under the radar actor, with his only major role playing Sherlock Holmes. However, after he was cast as Iron-Man, the one shot
movie that was supposed to be Iron Man, turned into a cornerstone for what we know today as the Marvel Cinimatic Universe. His casting broought forth the birth of the
Avengers, the Thor trilogy, Captain America, Spiderman and so many more. He is now the most important character in the MCU, and I hope it plans to stay that way. </p>
